     <h1>Week 2: Lego Family</h1>
    <p>The requirements for this project were to create four moving functions that moved from the corners of the canvas to the center. I chose to complete this with lego recreations of my own family: my fiance, Andrew, myself, and my two cats, Frederick and Knuffle.</p>
