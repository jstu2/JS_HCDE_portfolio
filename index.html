<h1>Julie Stuart</h1>
<p>Originally from Albuquerque, New Mexico, I left the warm southwest to venture out to Minneapolis, MN to pursue my undergraduate degree in psychology. While in Minneapolis, I was a trombone player in the University of Minnesota Marching Band and participated in three research labs varying in specialities from music therapy to social psychology to human-computer interaction. My love of research led me to pursuing my Master's in Human-Centered Design & Engineering at University of Washington in Seattle. My special interests include human decision making, human-computer interaction, international user experience, and visual perception.
In my free time, I enjoy cooking spicy foods, playing board games, and hiking throughout the Pacific Northwest.
